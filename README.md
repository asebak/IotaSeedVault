# IotaSeedVault
A vault for you [IOTA](https://iotatoken.com/) seeds. Completly offline and secure 

## Details
Project uses ``AES256`` and ``SHA256`` for encrypting the vault. You can generate a seed or store you existing seeds.

This is a full windows c# client. Feel free to look at the source, request feature changes or contribute your own changes.
Depending on popularity i will implement extra features and a linux/osx version aswell 

In the near future i will add more comments to my code and make sure there are no .dlls needed.

## Installation
Compile the soure or download the executable. Make sure the .dll files are with them when you move the app.
