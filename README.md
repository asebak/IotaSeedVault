# IotaSeedVault
A vault for you iota seeds. 

Project uses ``AES256`` and ``SHA256`` for encrypting the vault. You can generate a seed or store you existing seeds.

This is a full windows client. Feel free to look at the source, request feature changes or contribute your own changes.
Depending on popularity i will implement extra features and a linux/osx version aswell 

In the near future i will add more comments to my code

If you want to support this project, i only accept ``IOTA``:p.
